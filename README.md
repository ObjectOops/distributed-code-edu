Exposes [OpenVSCode Server](https://github.com/gitpod-io/openvscode-server) on a publicly accessible port and provides a starting page for navigating to hard-coded paths.
## Purpose
For teaching primary to intermediate school students how to program in Python.  
It is infeasible to strafe around a classroom peering over shoulders and individually helping each student.  
We can now also efficiently modify file contents without having to seize control of a device.
## Security
Close to none. But, this is designed for instructing people who don't know how to program, let alone use a computer, or even type.
